# Simple-Posts-Project

A simple project to display and add posts. This project is built on `React Native`. Therefore, it theoratically should run web, iOS and Android platforms. However, I just tested on my iOS devices. Although most functions should work, it is unsure what would happen in other platforms.

## Usage

To build the app, please install `expo` first:

```
$ npm install expo-cli --global
```

After installing the node modules, start the expo web server:

```
$ expo start
```

## Demo

See the gif below.
